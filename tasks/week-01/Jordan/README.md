# Todo List Application

A simple command-line todo list application built with html, css and javascript.

## Description

This application allows users to manage their tasks through a simple CLI interface. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, delete them, and view all tasks. 

## Language & Technologies

- **Language**: html 5, css and javascript
- **Libraries**: 
  - `json` (standard library) - for file persistence



## How to Run

`run in ide (vs code), click on run without debugging and access on local web browser.
```

## Features Implemented

### Core Features
- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ List all tasks with status
- ✅ Save tasks to file (persistence)



## Usage Example

```
=== Todo List Application ===

1. Add task
2. Mark task as complete
3. Delete task
4. List all tasks
5. Filter tasks
6. Exit


```

## File Structure

```
.
├── todo.html         # Main application file
├── README.md        # This file
└── daily-goals.md   # Daily progress tracking
```


## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would implement these features hopefully:
- Due dates and reminders
- Task priorities (high/medium/low)

## Testing

The application has been tested with:
- Adding multiple tasks
- Deleting tasks
- File persistence (closing and reopening the app)
- Error cases (invalid input)
