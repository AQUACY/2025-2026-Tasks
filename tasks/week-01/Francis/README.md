# Todo List Application

A simple command-line todo list application built with html, css and javascript.

## Description

This application allows users to manage their tasks through a simple CLI interface. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, delete them, and view all tasks. 

## Language & Technologies

- **Language**: html 5, css and javascript
- **Libraries**: 
  - `json` (standard library) - for file persistence



### Core Features
- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ List all tasks with status
- ✅ Save tasks to file (persistence)



```

## File Structure

```
.
├── todo.html         # Main application file
├── README.md        # This file
└── daily-goals.md   # Daily progress tracking
```


## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would implement these features hopefully:
- Due dates and reminders
- Task priorities (high/medium/low)
