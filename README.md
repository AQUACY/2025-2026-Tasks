# 2025-2026 Coding Tasks

This repository contains weekly coding tasks designed to sharpen your programming skills. Each week, you'll work on a project with daily goals to track your progress.

## 📋 How It Works

- **Weekly Tasks**: A new task is assigned each week (due Friday)
- **Daily Goals**: Break down the weekly task into daily milestones
- **Language Freedom**: Use any programming language you're comfortable with
- **GitHub Workflow**: Push your code daily so progress can be reviewed

## 📁 Repository Structure

│   └── task-template.md  # Template for weekly tasks
└── TASKS.md              # Master list of all tasks
```

## 🎯 Weekly Workflow

1. **Monday**: Review the weekly task and create your daily goals
2. **Tuesday-Thursday**: Work on daily goals and push progress daily
3. **Friday**: Complete the task and submit for review

## 📝 Daily Goals Template

Each team member should create a `daily-goals.md` file in their week folder with:

- **Monday**: Planning and setup
- **Tuesday**: Core feature implementation
- **Wednesday**: Additional features/testing
- **Thursday**: Refinement and bug fixes
- **Friday**: Final submission

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Check `TASKS.md` for the current week's task
2. Create a folder: `tasks/week-XX/your-name/`
3. Create your `daily-goals.md` file
4. Start coding and push daily!

## ✅ Submission Guidelines

- Push code daily (even if incomplete)
- Update `daily-goals.md` with your progress
- Include a README in your submission explaining:
  - Language used
  - How to run the project
  - Key features implemented
  - Challenges faced

**Happy Coding! 🎉**
